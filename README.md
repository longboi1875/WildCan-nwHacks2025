WildCan - nwHacks Project 2025

As a team of first-year students at the University of British Columbia, hacking at our first major hackathon, we set out to create a project with real impact. After countless hours of hard work, determination, and many hours of sleep sacrificed, we are proud to present WildCan!

What It Does

WildCan collects real-time data about wildfires of all sizes and integrates it into our dynamic data map. Using advanced parameters, the application calculates the potential impact radius of each fire. If a wildfire is detected near a user or within a predefined impact distance, WildCan instantly sends a notification to their phone. This ensures users are always aware of nearby threats and can take action to stay safe.

To personalize alerts, we collect user data, such as location and phone numbers, ensuring accurate notifications. Additionally, weâ€™ve included a donate page linking to a wildfire relief fund, so if our application inspires users to help, they can easily contribute to ongoing relief efforts.
